# Boat-Towing Boat Towing/UGV

Place "TOW" Folder inside main mission folder.


Use "this addaction ["Load","tow\load.sqf", [.4,1.2,2.2]];" in the "init" of the Unarmed UGV. (B_UGV_01_F)

The action to "load" and "Detach" will now appear on the UGV.

Put the Minigun Boat behind the UGV or the UGV in front of the Minigun boat.

Use a Hemtt or a Truck and attach the tow ropes from the Truck to the front of the UGV,then load the boat.

This does require the Advanced Towing script/or Mod from Duda to work.
